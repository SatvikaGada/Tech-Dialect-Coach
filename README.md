# Tech-Dialect-Coach  
A Speech Analysis and Interview Preparation Tool

## Project Description

Tech-Dialect-Coach is a web-based application designed to help users improve their interview skills through AI-powered speech analysis. The system provides:

- Practice sessions with categorized questions (General / Technical)  
- Real-time recording and analysis of verbal responses  
- Detailed feedback on pronunciation, grammar, and fluency  
- Progress tracking and performance analytics  

## Key Features

### Interactive Practice Interface
- Dynamic question loading from predefined sets  
- Audio recording via browser microphone  

### Speech Analysis
- Pronunciation scoring  
- Grammar and fluency evaluation  
- Confidence level assessment  

### User Contributions
- Community-driven question bank  
- Local storage for user-submitted questions  

### Progress Tracking
- Session history  
- Performance metrics  
- Improvement trends  

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Libraries: Web Speech API, MediaRecorder API  
- Storage: localStorage for persistent data
